# Chatbot for Placement Cell
###### A project for INT404

For this project we used Keras, which runs on top of TensorFlow, to build, train, and use neural network to make predictions for most appropriate response. Keras generates a model using a set of responses designed to suit a placement cell. 

## How to use
- Clone the repository
- Install the required packages by running the following command
  `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  Note: TensorFlow requires 64-bit version of python3 installed. This bot will not function without TensorFlow
- Run **train_chatbot.py** to generate the model
- Run **chatgui.py** to run the chatbot
